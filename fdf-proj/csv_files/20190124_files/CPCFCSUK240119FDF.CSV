FX Forwards (will these forwards be under the synthetics section? Not members of baskets? Add on rate to the creation/ reademption rate, well just for creation, well instead of 10 bps, add another 5 to purchase the Forwards. Flat rate. EEM and HEEM have values in FX Forwards, IEMG as well, 6,7,8 entries here... Fund level? or basket level? Fund Forwards... might be a separate data product that we don't have now. Daily fund forwards, from and to currency... enough to identify the fund. Nothing to do with basket, Fund we want, one line per day. )
